# challenge

Service to transfer fund from one account to another account 


Points to make this service Production-Ready:
1. Need to secure REST APIs with Spring Security by using OAuth2/JWT, Basic Auth etc.
2. Need to implement Resilience4j for retry, fallback, circuit breaker, and bulkhead.
3. Need to use production-grade database like PostgreSQL, MySQL etc.
4. Need to add Spring boot actuator to monitor and manage service effectively. Grafana and prometheus can be used for monitoring.
5. Need to add API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI (Springdoc)
6. Need to setup the CI/CD pipeline for automated build and deployment
